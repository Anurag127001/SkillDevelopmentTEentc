            <h2>3. Hands-On Session on Microwind</h2>
            <img src="/guestLecs/Guest Lectures/HandsOnSession.jpg" alt="Microwind Hands-On Session">
            <p>Continuing our tradition of practical learning, the IEEE chapter recently organized a hands-on session on Microwind, a tool used for designing and simulating CMOS circuits. The session was organized by Prof. Vijayalaxmi Kumbhar, who guided students through the process of creating and testing basic integrated circuits using Microwind.</p>
            <p>Participants were able to design their own circuits, simulate their behavior, and analyze the results. This experience not only deepened their understanding of semiconductor design but also sparked an interest in pursuing careers in VLSI and chip design.</p>
