                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Mrs. Vijayalaxmi Sandeep Kumbhar, an Assistant Professor in the E&TC Engineering Department with 14 years of teaching experience. I hold a Master's degree in VLSI & Embedded Systems and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. from G H Raisoni College of Engineering and Management, Pune.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since joining academia in June 2015, I have been deeply committed to both teaching and research. My journey has been marked by various achievements, including receiving a $2,000 grant from IEEE TryEngineering for organizing the "IEEE Epoxy Solar Camp 1.0" workshop and a $322 grant for my project on the "Autonomous Floor Cleaning Robot." I have also had the privilege of serving as an IEEE STEM Ambassador in 2021, where I conducted workshops such as "Tinkercad and 3D Printer" for pre-university students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My involvement with the IEEE community has been a significant part of my career. I have taken on leadership roles such as Chair and Vice Chair of SIGHT Pratham IEEE Bombay Section and have contributed to various IEEE events, including the IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference and the IEEE Region 10 Symposium, where I served as a track chair and speaker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my teaching and research responsibilities, I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of engineers. Through various STEM workshops, I have had the opportunity to reach and benefit over 350 students. Additionally, I serve as the NBA Department Coordinator, focusing on students’ performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the impact I have made through my work and remain committed to advancing education, technology, and community engagement in my field.
