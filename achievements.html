                In 2021, I had the honor of serving as an IEEE STEM Ambassador. This role allowed me to actively promote STEM education and inspire others to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. My contributions to the STEM community were recognized in the official newsletter for that year, highlighting my involvement and impact.

This certification is just one example of the many courses and programs I have undertaken to enhance my expertise and stay at the forefront of technological advancements.
