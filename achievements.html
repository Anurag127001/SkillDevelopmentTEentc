                    <h2>My Achievements</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am proud to be among the top 2% of my college, reflecting a dedication to academic excellence and a strong commitment to my field. Achieving an impressive 82% in certifications, I have continually sought to expand my knowledge and skills through various programs and courses.

                        In 2021, I had the honor of serving as an IEEE STEM Ambassador. This role allowed me to actively promote STEM education and inspire others to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. My contributions to the STEM community were recognized in the official newsletter for that year, highlighting my involvement and impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my notable achievements is my certification from NPTEL, a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and professional development. This certification is just one example of the many courses and programs I have undertaken to enhance my expertise and stay at the forefront of technological advancements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey is marked by a blend of academic success, active participation in STEM initiatives, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. I am excited to continue my journey, driven by a passion for learning and a desire to make meaningful contributions to my field.
