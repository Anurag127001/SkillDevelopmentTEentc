            <h2>Celebrating IEEE Recognition for Autonomous Sanitizing Floor Cleaner Robot</h2>
            <img src="/grants/Grants/R10 HTA-020.JPG" alt="IEEE Certificate">
            <p>We are proud to announce that our team has received a <strong>Certificate of Completion</strong> from the <strong>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</strong> for the successful development of our <strong>Autonomous Sanitizing Floor Cleaner Robot</strong>. This project was a collaborative effort aimed at addressing the urgent needs of the local community during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>The robot, which was designed and implemented as part of a joint initiative by members of <strong>IEEE Region 110</strong>, played a critical role in maintaining hygiene in public spaces. It autonomously sanitized floors, reducing the risk of virus transmission and contributing to the overall public health efforts.</p>
            <p>This certificate from IEEE is a testament to our team's dedication to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in times of crisis. We are honored by this recognition and remain committed to using engineering and innovation to make a positive impact on society.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates on our ongoing projects and achievements!</p>

            <h2>IEEE Pre-University STEM Portal Grant Program 2021: Empowering Young Innovators</h2>
            <p>We are thrilled to share that our <strong>"Epoxy Based Solar Panel Making Workshop"</strong> has been awarded funding through the <strong>IEEE Pre-University STEM Portal Grant Program 2021</strong>! This initiative aims to inspire and educate pre-university students in STEM fields, and our workshop was selected from among 83 submissions worldwide.</p>
            <p>This workshop will provide students with hands-on experience in creating solar panels using epoxy, fostering a deeper understanding of renewable energy. Our goal is to ignite a passion for technology and innovation in the next generation of students.</p>
            <p>We are excited to begin this project and will be documenting our journey here on the blog. We are grateful to the IEEE for their support and recognition, and we look forward to sharing the outcomes of our workshop with the broader community.</p>
