            </div>
            <p>Under the guidance of our esteemed faculty and in collaboration with the IEEE department, our students organized the GoGreen event, a unique initiative focused on promoting sustainability in the field of electronics and telecommunication. The event aimed to raise awareness about the environmental impact of electronic waste and encouraged the adoption of green practices in the industry.</p>
            <p>The GoGreen event featured a series of workshops, panel discussions, and hands-on activities that educated participants on topics such as e-waste management, energy-efficient circuit design, and the use of renewable energy sources in electronics. The event was a resounding success, with students and faculty alike gaining valuable insights into the intersection of technology and sustainability.</p>

            <h2>4. Hands-On Session: Bridging Theory and Practice</h2>
            <img src="/allEvents/Handsonsession_4.jpg" alt="Hands-On Session">
            <p>One of the core objectives of IEEE is to provide students with opportunities to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world challenges. In line with this goal, we recently conducted a hands-on session where participants were introduced to the basics of microcontroller programming and embedded systems.</p>
            <p>During this session, students worked in teams to develop simple yet functional prototypes using Arduino and other microcontrollers. This practical experience not only reinforced their understanding of key concepts but also sparked their interest in pursuing further projects in embedded systems. The session was an engaging and educational experience for all involved, exemplifying the value of experiential learning within our IEEE chapter.</p>

            <h2>5. IEEE Quarter 3 Seminar: A Hub for Knowledge Exchange</h2>
            <img src="/allEvents/IEEE QT3.png" alt="Quarter 3 Seminar">
            <p>To round off our quarter, the IEEE department organized a seminar that brought together students, faculty, and industry experts to discuss the latest trends and developments in electronics and telecommunication. The IEEE Quarter 3 Seminar covered a wide range of topics, including the future of 5G technology, advancements in semiconductor devices, and the role of artificial intelligence in telecommunications.</p>
            <p>The seminar provided a platform for attendees to engage in thought-provoking discussions, share their research, and network with professionals in the field. The event was a testament to the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of IEEE, fostering an environment where knowledge is freely exchanged, and innovation thrives.</p>
